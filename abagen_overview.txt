Did you know there’s a tool that connects genetics with brain maps?
It’s called Abagen, a Python toolbox made by researchers from McGill University.

Abagen helps scientists work with the Allen Human Brain Atlas — a massive dataset showing how thousands of genes are expressed across the human brain.

The problem?
There are many ways to process this data, and small changes can lead to totally different results.
That’s where Abagen comes in — it standardizes the workflow, making brain gene-expression analysis reproducible and transparent.

With just a few lines of code, Abagen takes raw microarray data and turns it into a clean matrix that shows which genes are active in which brain regions.

It’s open-source, easy to install with pip install abagen, and widely used in neuroimaging and neuroscience studies.

In short — Abagen helps us understand how our genes shape the structure and function of the human brain, one dataset at a time.
